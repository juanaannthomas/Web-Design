     <p>A brief history of Kanjirappally Pazhayapally (St.Mary’s Church) and the Puthenpally (St.Dominic’s Cathedral). The Old Church (St.Mary’s Church) and the market nearby have been constructed on a piece of land donated by the erstwhile King of Thekkemcore Sri. Veerakerala Perumal who was ruling the eastern areas including Kanjirappally on the 21st of Medam in the year K.V.624. (K V is for Malayalam year Kolla Varsham). On this plot the location of the Church building was decided by the King himself by planting a green stick on the chosen spot. So for those Christains who migrated from Nilakkal 100 years ago under the leadership of an elderly man named Thommi, who was also the trustee of the Nilakkal curch,got a church for the first time. They had to leave Nilakkal due to attack of burglars, spread of deadly virus diseases and wild insects called Vakri puli perumpatta. Until the new church was consecrated those people were going to the curch in Aruvithura (Erattupetta) for worship and their spiritual needs.</p>
